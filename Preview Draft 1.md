This website preview is the bare bones of my site. I’m still figuring out how to write html so this is a bit difficult for me, but I do have the general structure of the site. Right now, I have my three main sections: publications, digital media, and projects, with some of my images coded into the three of the sections. I really don’t have much else to show for this first draft, other than the bones of what is to come. Coding in html takes a lot longer than expected, especially as someone who has never done this before and has no knowledge of it. I left off here because I’m having trouble resizing my images and formatting them to fit correctly into their particular section. My next steps are to upload all my images in, size them properly, and include all the links I need. Links to each of the three different sections, and a link to an about page which will include a link to my LinkedIn profile. I also want to perfect my site’s layout and aesthetics, as it is really mediocre at the moment. I already know the font I want to use, Glacial Indifference, to match the font I used on my resume and cover letter. I am also keeping the color scheme consistent to my resume and cover letter.
