# Project 3: Website Portfolio

My website project is a digital portfolio for myself, showcasing mostly my "outside the classroom" accomplishments: my publications with The Pitt News, Instinctif Partners, and Fidelity Investments, as well as some digital media creations for a past job at a local record store and for university projects.
